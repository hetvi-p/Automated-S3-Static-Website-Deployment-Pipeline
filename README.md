# Automated-S3-Static-Website-Deployment-Pipeline
This project automates the deployment of static websites hosted on Amazon S3 whenever code is committed to a specific branch in an AWS CodeCommit repository. The approach provides a central deployment pipeline that can be easily extended to include features such as code reviews, builds, and tests.
