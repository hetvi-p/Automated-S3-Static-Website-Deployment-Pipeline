# S3 Static Website Automated Deployments

## Overview

This project automates the deployment of static websites hosted on Amazon S3 whenever code is committed to a specific branch in an AWS CodeCommit repository. The approach provides a central deployment pipeline that can be easily extended to include features such as code reviews, builds, and tests.

## Architecture

The deployment workflow is structured as follows:

```
CodeCommit -> CodePipeline -> Lambda -> S3 Static Website
```

### Technologies Used

- **AWS CodeCommit**: Source control service that hosts the code repository.
- **AWS CodePipeline**: Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) service that automates the build, test, and deployment phases.
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless compute service that runs code in response to events, utilized here as a custom action in CodePipeline.
- **Amazon S3**: Storage service for hosting the static website.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime used for developing the Lambda function.

## Features

- **Automated Deployments**: Automatically deploy your static website to S3 whenever changes are pushed to the specified branch in CodeCommit.
- **Custom Lambda Function**: The deployment process is managed by a Lambda function, ensuring efficient and scalable operations.
- **Centralized Pipeline**: Easily extend the deployment pipeline to include additional stages such as testing and code reviews.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- An AWS account with programmatic access.
- AWS CLI installed and configured.
- An S3 bucket in the `us-east-1` region (CodeCommit is currently only available here).

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alexgibs/StaticS3Deploy.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd StaticS3Deploy.git
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Install the necessary dependencies for the Lambda function:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Package the Lambda Function**:
   Create a zip archive of the required files for the Lambda function:
   ```bash
   zip -r StaticS3SiteDeploy.zip index.js node_modules/
   ```

5. **Upload the Lambda Function Zip to S3**:
   Upload the zip archive to an S3 bucket in the `us-east-1` region:
   ```bash
   aws s3 cp StaticS3SiteDeploy.zip s3://<your-bucket> --region us-east-1
   ```

6. **Deploy the CloudFormation Stack**:
   Deploy the CloudFormation stack in `us-east-1` using the provided `codepipeline.json` template to set up the pipeline and Lambda function.

### Caveats

- The Lambda function extracts the output artifact from CodeCommit to the `/tmp` directory, which has a 512 MB limit. If your codebase exceeds this size, consider modifying the function to handle individual files instead of extracting all at once.

## Skills and Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I gained valuable experience and skills, including:

- **AWS Cloud Services**: Deepened my understanding of key AWS services and how they interact in a CI/CD pipeline.
- **Automation**: Developed automation skills by creating a deployment pipeline that reduces manual intervention.
- **Serverless Computing**: Learned to leverage AWS Lambda for executing code in response to events without managing servers.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Gained experience in using AWS CloudFormation to provision infrastructure efficiently.
- **Problem-Solving**: Addressed limitations of serverless architectures and optimized deployment processes.

## Conclusion

This project provides an efficient way to automate static website deployments on Amazon S3, showcasing my proficiency in AWS services and CI/CD practices. By implementing this automation, I can focus on development and enhancement rather than manual deployment processes.
